# !!! READ THIS !!!

I have absolutely no time to completely rewrite the plugin. My current work takes too much time. 
If you want an update of the plugin, I let you go to [JustOptimize](https://github.com/JustOptimize/return-ShowHiddenChannels) repo

# Who is the Creator ?

The creator of this plugin is [DevilBro](https://mwittrien.github.io/)

I have completely reworked the plugin so that it can use the BDFDB library from **DevilBro** !

:warning: No need to use the custom BDFDB library :warning:

How to use **ShowHiddenChannels**, follow these steps :arrow_down:

# First, deleting old files

Go to this path:  `C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Roaming\BetterDiscord\plugins` then delete these files:

- `0BDFDB.config.json`
- `0BDFDB.data.json`
- `0BDFDB.plugin.js`
- `0BDFDB.raw.css`
- `ShowHiddenChannels.plugin.js`
- `ShowHiddenChannels.config.json`

# Second, Download new files

Go to this path:  `C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Roaming\BetterDiscord\plugins` then download these two files and put them here:

- [BDFDB from DevilBro](https://betterdiscord.app/plugin/BDFDB)

This `ShowHiddenChannels` file has been renamed by `ReShowHiddenChannels`. To prevent it from being deleted by the BDFDB library

- [ShowHiddenChannels](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeiyaGame/Discord-ShowHiddenChannels/main/ReShowHiddenChannels.plugin.js)
